## Outline

Produce a Companion specification — **no user-story / user-scenario section**. Capture intent as testable requirements, not narrative journeys.

1. **Resolve the feature directory — mint a fresh dir for new work.** `.specify/feature.json` is an **output** of this step, not an input to reuse: it points at the *previous* spec (frequently already completed), so reusing it would clobber finished work. Pick the target:
   - If the request explicitly names a target path (or `SPECIFY_FEATURE_DIRECTORY` is set), use it.
   - Otherwise create the next numbered dir: scan `specs/` for the highest `NNN-…` prefix, derive a 2–4 word short-name from the description, and use `specs/<NNN+1>-<short-name>/`. **Never write into a directory that already contains a `spec.md`** — that's a stale pointer to a prior spec, not this feature.
   Create `<feature_directory>/`, point `.specify/feature.json` at it, then record the **specify START** so the step's duration begins now (the script stamps the real clock — do not hand-write this):
   ```bash
   python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_directory> --step specify --status specifying --kind start --by extension
   ```

2. Create `<feature_directory>/spec.md` with exactly these sections, in order:
   - **Overview** — 1–3 sentences: what this delivers and why. No implementation detail. (This replaces the stock user-scenarios narrative.)
   - **Functional Requirements** — a numbered `FR-001…` list. Each requirement is a single, testable MUST/SHOULD statement. Mark a genuinely unresolvable choice with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` (max 3; prefer informed defaults).
   - **Success Criteria** — measurable, technology-agnostic `SC-001…` outcomes (time, count, percentage, pass/fail). No framework or API names.
   - **Assumptions** — the informed defaults you chose for anything unspecified.

3. Keep it business-readable. Do **not** add user stories, acceptance-scenario tables, or priority labels — Companion tracks requirements and outcomes directly. Fold edge cases into Functional Requirements or Assumptions.

4. **Spec quality checklist.** Write `<feature_directory>/checklists/requirements.md` using the template below, then run a **single** self-check pass: grade each item pass/fail, fix obvious fails in `spec.md` in place, and leave any genuine ambiguity as a `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: …]` marker (max 3) for the `clarify` step. Do **not** run a multi-iteration rewrite loop or prompt the user with option tables — Companion defers interactive clarification to `clarify`. Update the checklist to reflect the final pass/fail state.

   # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]

   **Purpose**: Validate Companion specification completeness before planning
   **Created**: [DATE]
   **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]

   ## Content Quality

   - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
   - [ ] Focused on user/business value and the change's intent
   - [ ] Overview states what is delivered and why in 1–3 sentences
   - [ ] All four sections present (Overview, Functional Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions)

   ## Requirement Completeness

   - [ ] Any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are genuine ambiguities (≤3) deferred to clarify — not unresolved guesses
   - [ ] Each Functional Requirement is a single, testable MUST/SHOULD statement
   - [ ] Success criteria are measurable
   - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
   - [ ] Edge cases are folded into Functional Requirements or Assumptions
   - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
   - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

   ## Feature Readiness

   - [ ] Every Functional Requirement maps to at least one Success Criterion
   - [ ] Overview intent is reflected by the FR list (no orphan goals)
   - [ ] No implementation details leak into the specification

   ## Notes

   - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before clarify or plan
   ```

5. **Classify the change — right-size the ceremony.** After the spec content is drafted, decide whether this change is small enough to fast-track straight to implement, or large enough to keep the full specify → plan → tasks → implement pipeline. Apply the shared size definition below — the same one the standalone size step uses, so the small/large bar is authored in exactly one place. This is a best-effort heuristic and **MUST err toward `normal`** on weak or conflicting signals — a change is never under-planned by accident.

<!-- speckit-companion:part sizing -->
- **small** — the change plausibly touches **≤ 5 files** and decomposes into **≤ 10 tasks**.
- **oversized** — the change clearly exceeds the small bar by a wide margin (broad multi-subsystem
  work, many new files, or a long task list).
- **normal** — anything in between (the default).

The two constants (5 files / 10 tasks) are the same guardrail the old `complexityFastPath` used.
<!-- /speckit-companion:part sizing -->

   Estimate `projectedFiles` and `projectedTasks` for the drafted requirements, and read a `scopeSignal` from the wording (`"larger"` for rewrite | overhaul | new system | migration | redesign | …; `"smaller"` for one-line | rename | typo | tweak | copy change | …; else `"none"`). Then map the size definition above to a verdict:

   ```
   crossedGuardrail = the change exceeds the **small** bar above (more files or tasks than it allows)

   verdict = "simple" if  the change is **small** by the definition above
                      and scopeSignal != "larger"
             else "normal"
   ```

   - **Guardrail warning.** When `crossedGuardrail == true` OR `scopeSignal == "larger"`, print this line verbatim, then run the **normal** branch (never a silent fast-track):

     ```
     [companion] Change exceeds the small-change guardrail (5 files / 10 tasks) — running the full pipeline.
     ```

     Exactly-at-threshold (`projectedFiles == 5` / `projectedTasks == 10`) is the simple ceiling — it does **not** warn and stays eligible for `simple`.

6. **Branch on the verdict.**

   - **`simple` — minimal mode.** Write **three lean files** in this one pass so the file-driven views (top stepper, sidebar, implement progress) reconcile with the history-driven fold — never a single combined `spec.md`:
     - Append an **Approach** section to the already-written `spec.md` — the files to touch and any dependencies, in a few bullets (the plan content, inline; this stays the plan source-of-truth).
     - Write `<feature_directory>/plan.md` as a **short pointer** to the spec's Approach (e.g. a one-line blockquote linking `./spec.md#approach` and `./tasks.md`). Do **not** duplicate the approach bullets — `plan.md` references them.
     - Write `<feature_directory>/tasks.md` carrying the **real task checklist** — a dependency-ordered list, one per line as `- [ ] **T001** [P?] <description> + <path>` (`[P]` marks tasks that can run in parallel). This MUST be the actual checklist, not a pointer: implement progress counts these checkboxes, so a pointer would read 0/0.

     Put the task checklist **only** in `tasks.md` — do **not** keep a second copy in `spec.md` (the duplicate would drift). `spec.md` keeps the Approach; `tasks.md` owns the tasks.

     Still write `<feature_directory>/checklists/requirements.md` as in step 4. Do **not** run `/speckit.companion.plan` or `/speckit.companion.tasks` — the three lean files plus the lifecycle fold below record those steps as satisfied.
   - **`normal` — full pipeline.** Write `spec.md` only (no appended Approach section, no `plan.md` / `tasks.md` here, no lifecycle fold). The existing pipeline continues unchanged: plan and tasks are produced and recorded by their own `/speckit.companion.plan` and `/speckit.companion.tasks` runs.

**Output**: `<feature_directory>/spec.md` + `<feature_directory>/checklists/requirements.md`. In **simple** mode, `spec.md` additionally carries an **Approach** section, and two lean files are emitted alongside it — `plan.md` (a pointer to that Approach) and `tasks.md` (the real `- [ ] **T001** …` checklist; the task list lives here, not in `spec.md`); in **normal** mode, `spec.md` holds the four sections only and no `plan.md` / `tasks.md` are written here.

**Record completion.** After `spec.md` is written, close the specify step — the extension stamps the real end (do **not** hand-write an `ai` complete for specify):
```bash
python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_directory> --step specify --status specified --kind complete --by extension
```

**Fast-path lifecycle fold (simple mode only).** When `verdict == "simple"`, record the folded `plan` and `tasks` steps so the history-driven panels read them as satisfied-by-fast-path — pairing with the lean `plan.md` / `tasks.md` files above, which make the file-driven stepper, sidebar, and implement progress agree — and the spec lands ready for implement. Run these **in order, after** the specify completion above (each call stamps its own real clock — do not hand-write these, and do not run them for a `normal` verdict):
```bash
python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_directory> --step plan  --kind start    --substep fast-path --by ai
python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_directory> --step plan  --kind complete --substep fast-path --by ai
python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_directory> --step tasks --kind start    --substep fast-path --by ai
python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_directory> --step tasks --kind complete --substep fast-path --status ready-to-implement --by ai
```
After the fold, the spec sits at the **tasks** step with `status: ready-to-implement`; the developer triggers implement next. Do **not** write a `completed` status — the final completed gate stays a user action.


<!-- speckit-companion:part timing -->
## Timing — keep `.spec-context.json` honest

These rules apply to every Companion profile command. The extension records lifecycle timing with its own scripts wherever it can; these rules keep anything you append consistent with that and accurate for any dispatcher (terminal, IDE chat, or the GUI). The model is **finish-only**: each task and each substep records a *single* finish event, and its duration is the gap to the previous finish (or the step's start). Never a `start`+`complete` pair for a task or substep — a pair stamped at one instant is what produces `0s` ticks and bursts.

- **Live timestamps.** When you append a history entry yourself, stamp it by running `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` at that moment. Never hand-type a timestamp, never reuse an earlier value, never stamp several entries with one shared value.
- **Self-close — but not specify or implement.** When your own work for **plan, tasks, clarify, or analyze** ends, append `{ "step": "<this step>", "substep": null, "kind": "complete", "by": "ai", "at": "<date -u output>" }`. Do NOT self-close **specify** or **implement**: the extension closes those itself (specify from its own command, implement from the end-of-step hook), so an `ai` complete there would duplicate it.
- **Substeps — one finish each.** For each substep boundary (plan: `research`, `design`; tasks: `generate`) append a single finish `{ "step": "<step>", "substep": "<name>", "kind": "complete", "by": "ai", "at": "<fresh date -u>" }` the moment that substep ends. One entry per substep, each with its own real timestamp — never two substeps sharing a value, never a separate `start`. The delta between consecutive finishes is each substep's duration.
- **Implement — journal each task with a script (finish-only).** As you finish each task: mark it `- [x] **<TaskID>**` in `tasks.md`, then run (feature dir from `.specify/feature.json`):

  ```bash
  python3 .specify/extensions/companion/scripts/write-context.py --feature-dir <feature_dir> --task <TaskID> --kind complete --by ai --did "<one-line summary of what this task did>" --files "<comma,separated,files,touched>"
  ```

  The `--did`/`--files` flags make the script write `task_summaries.<TaskID>` (the field the Activity panel's Tasks card reads) in the same call that records the finish — so the panel is populated by the script, NOT by a hand-authored `.spec-context.json` edit. Do NOT also hand-edit `task_summaries` yourself; the script owns it. Run this **the moment that task completes** — one finish per task, as you go. Do NOT defer journaling to the end of the step and do NOT dump every task's finish in one end-of-step batch: that collapses their real durations into a single instant, and the cadence check now FAILS a run whose task finishes are clustered into a tiny fraction of the step's real duration. This stamps **one** finish event from the real clock — its delta to the previous task's finish is that task's duration. Do NOT hand-author per-task JSON and do NOT write a per-task `start`. The end-of-step hook is a backstop that fills any task you didn't journal (it won't duplicate one you did). Parallel `[P]` tasks: journal each as it finishes; the batch's time is attributed to whichever finishes last (accepted limitation).
- **Never write the next step's start.** Only the next command appends the next step's start entry; writing it here makes the viewer render a phantom "Generating <next>…".

<!-- speckit-companion:part self-advance -->
## Self-advance — hand off to the next step

This is one step in the Companion pipeline. How the run continues depends on the environment you are running in; do not invoke a separate headless/deterministic run command for the everyday flow.

- **On an agentic CLI that keeps acting after a step finishes:** once this step's work is complete, read the Companion workflow definition (`speckit-extension/workflows/speckit-companion.workflow.yml`) to learn which step comes next, then continue into it on your own — dispatch the next step's `/speckit.companion.*` command and keep going through the pipeline.
- **Pause at every review gate.** Where the workflow marks a `gate` (e.g. review-spec, review-plan), stop and wait for approval rather than running past it. Only continue once the gate is approved.
- **Terminal step after implement.** After the implementation step finishes (and any commit step), the workflow's final step is `mark-complete`. Run it so the spec lands at `status: completed`. That step writes `completed` only through `write-context.py --mark-complete`, which refuses unless the spec is already `implemented` — never introduce a second completed-writer.
- **Degrade gracefully on a one-shot environment.** If your environment runs one step and then stops, the handoff simply does not fire: finish this step, record its progress, and stop. The run stays valid and resumable, and the next step is triggered manually (by the developer or the companion panel). Completion likewise stays a manual action there.

## Node hooks — run the project's `before`/`after` inserts

This command is assembled from ordered **nodes**. A project can attach its own work at the boundary *before* or *after* any node by declaring it in `.specify/companion.yml`. You are the runtime: read that file (if present) and run those hooks at the right moments. Like the rest of the pipeline, this must **never fail the host command** — degrade and continue.

**Find the hooks for this command.** Look up `commands.<this-command>.hooks` in `.specify/companion.yml`. It has two anchors, `before` and `after`, each keyed by a node id from this command's order. Run a node's `before` hooks immediately before that node's work, and its `after` hooks immediately after. When several hooks sit at one anchor, run them **top to bottom, in declared order**.

**Hook types:**

- `{ type: command, run: "<shell>" }` — run the shell command with your terminal/Bash tool, then continue. *If you have no terminal tool* (some chat-only providers), do not pretend to: report the command you would have run and continue.
- `{ type: prompt, text: "<instruction>" }` — treat the text as an inline instruction and act on it before moving on.
- `{ type: node, ref: <id> }` — read `.specify/companion/nodes/<id>.md` and carry out its body as if it were part of this command.

**Background hooks.** Any hook may add `background: true`. Kick it off and continue the pipeline immediately without waiting for it to finish — it must not hold the spec prisoner. Use it for slow, independent side-effects (a test run, a build, a notification): for a `command`, launch it detached (e.g. append `&` or use `nohup … &`); for a `node`/`prompt`, do its work without blocking the next step. Report its result whenever it lands, but never block on it. **Do not** mark a `background` hook on anything that writes `.spec-context.json` (the timing/capture calls): those are fast already and run a read-modify-write on the shared file, so two of them racing in the background can lose an update. Background is for side-effects, not bookkeeping.

**Failure handling (never abort the host command):**

- **No `.specify/companion.yml`** → there are no hooks; run the command exactly as written. Do not warn.
- **The file is malformed / unparseable** → ignore it, note one short warning, and run the shipped command unchanged.
- **A hook is anchored to a node that isn't in this run's order** (e.g. a recipe dropped it) → warn once and skip that anchor's hooks.
- **A `type: node` hook's `ref` file is missing** → this is a real misconfiguration: report it clearly and stop before doing damage, rather than silently skipping.

If a hook's own work fails (a `command` exits non-zero, a `node` can't complete), report it and — unless the failure clearly makes the rest unsafe — continue the pipeline. The host command's own output is never blocked by a hook.
